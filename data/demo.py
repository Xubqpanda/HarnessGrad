"""A tiny local dataset adapter.

Purpose: exercise the whole loop (rounds, curve points, ckpts, caching,
cross-method comparison) with zero network and zero cost, so the framework can
be validated before any paid evaluation is wired in.

The reference `loop` harness scores 0/8 on this by construction -- it has no
file-reading ability and always answers with the same token. That is intended:
a base harness with a visible gap is what makes the first curve a curve rather
than a flat line. Scoring is exact-match and lives in `eval/`, never here.
