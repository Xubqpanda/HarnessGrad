"""A task set that needs more than one model call.

The demo set asks for a word, which one call answers -- so every harness scores the
same and no method can demonstrate anything. These tasks require *doing something and
checking it*: creating a file, running code, fixing an error. A harness that stops
after one model call cannot pass them; one that iterates can. That gap is what a
method needs in order to have anything to accept or reject.

#: Four to study, two to be scored on. The eval side is deliberately small --
#: this set exists to be cheap -- and that has a visible cost the platform
#: reports rather than hides: with n=2 the score can only move in steps of 0.5.
