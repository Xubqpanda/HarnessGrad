"""Terminal-Bench 2 as a dataset. INTERFACE.md §2.5.9.

    python tools/import_env.py ...          # not needed: every task ships an image
    driver.py --dataset terminal_bench ...

Where the task set lives
------------------------
A checkout of `harbor-framework/terminal-bench-2` (measured: 89 tasks, 83 MB, 117 MB for
a sample image). It is deliberately outside the platform tree:

    HG_TERMINAL_BENCH   default /mnt/20t/xubuqiang/Study/terminal-bench-2

Each task is a directory with a uniform shape -- measured across all 89, with no
exceptions: `instruction.md`, `task.toml`, `environment/` (a Dockerfile, often with
encrypted data), `tests/test.sh` + `tests/test_outputs.py`, and `solution/`.

What it costs to get the images
-------------------------------
Every task ships a prebuilt image, so nothing is *built* — but 89 images have to be
**pulled**, once, by `tools/import_env.py` (§2.5.5). Measured: ~104 GB on disk, and the
distribution is very uneven — most are hundreds of megabytes while `mteb-retrieve` is
**21.6 GB** and the `qemu-*` pair are 3.15 GB each. On a host whose registry access is a
flaky mirror, those large blobs are exactly what fails: three tasks
(`mteb-leaderboard`, `pytorch-model-recovery`, `reshard-c4-data`) could not be fetched here
at all, failing with `TLS handshake timeout` partway through a layer. That is an external
limit with a name, not a platform defect, and it is worth checking disk before starting:
the images are the run's largest fixed cost by two orders of magnitude.

What maps to what
-----------------
| Terminal-Bench | here |
| --- | --- |
| `instruction.md` | the task's `goal` |
| `task.toml` `environment.docker_image` | `env.image` (a tag; the driver pins it and refuses to start without a digest) |
| `task.toml` `environment.allow_internet` | `env.network` (`bridge` / `none`) |
| `task.toml` `environment.cpus` / `memory_mb` | `env.cpus` / `env.memory_mb` |
| `task.toml` `agent.timeout_sec` / `verifier.timeout_sec` | `env.agent_timeout_s` / `env.verify_timeout_s` |
| the image's `WORKDIR` | `env.workdir`, and `state: "container"` because the task lives there |
| `tests/` | `VERIFY.inputs` with `dst: /tests` -- copied in **after** the harness stops |
| `/logs/verifier/reward.txt` | `VERIFY.reward_file` |

`SETUP` is empty on purpose: the environment is the image's, and every task's Dockerfile
does its own `COPY`. That is also why the state has to be `container` rather than a bind
mount -- measured: the image ships `/app` **empty** and the instruction says to write
`/app/ars.R`, so the task's own idea of where it lives is the container.

All 89 are single-container, and a metadata flag said otherwise
--------------------------------------------------------------
The first version of this adapter excluded `mcmc-sampling-stan` and `rstan-to-pystan`
because their `task.toml` carries `metadata.custom_docker_compose = True`. That was
**wrong**, and it was wrong in the direction that quietly shrinks a benchmark: the flag is
stale. Measured over the whole checkout:

    metadata.custom_docker_compose true:  2 tasks
    docker-compose files present:         0

Both tasks' `environment/` holds a self-contained `Dockerfile` -- `FROM ubuntu:24.04`,
its packages, `WORKDIR /app`, `COPY task-deps/...` -- and each one carries the line
`# Fields moved from docker-compose.yaml`. They were migrated to single containers and
the flag was never cleared.

So nothing is excluded, and `EXCLUDED` is kept with nothing in it because the mechanism
is still the right one: if a task genuinely needs a multi-container environment it should
be named here rather than silently dropped, so that a curve's task count can be
reconciled against the benchmark's own. It is empty because no task needs it -- which is
a finding, and one that cost two tasks when it was assumed rather than checked.

A split the benchmark does not have
-----------------------------------
Terminal-Bench is an exam, not a training set: it declares no train/eval split, and the
platform's contract wants one because a method needs diagnostics to work from and must not
be scored on them (§2.3). So the split is **imposed here**, derived from the task id so it
is stable across runs and reproducible from the record, and it is stated loudly because a
score on the eval side is a score on a third of the benchmark, not on the benchmark.
`HG_TB_SPLIT=none` runs everything as eval and accepts the warning the driver prints.
