"""A worked example of the task contract in INTERFACE.md §2.4: environment + verifier.

Why this dataset exists
-----------------------
The other two datasets (`demo`, `probe_set`) predate verifiers and declare only
`TASKS` + `SCORABLE`. That path is still supported and still correct, but it can only
express "answer a short question" — the task's environment is an empty directory and
the grade is a string comparison.

These tasks are the ones that contract could not express:

    v01  a program is broken; fix it so its own test passes
    v02  produce a file with specific contents
    v03  the two kinds side by side, so a dataset can mix them
    v04  a task whose grade is a directory's contents, not one file

Two things here are the whole point, and both are easy to get wrong:

1. **`SETUP` is what the harness receives; `VERIFY` is what it must not.** The task
   dict (`TASKS`) is written to `task.json` and handed to the harness verbatim, so
   nothing secret may live there. `data/registry.py` enforces that.
2. **`v01`'s verifier re-writes its own test file.** The harness is free to edit
   anything in its working directory, tests included — so a grade that reads the
   harness's copy of the test is not a grade. Re-materialising `inputs` at
   verification time is what makes the check meaningful, and `test_verifier.py`
   pins it by running a harness that edits the test file and asserting it still fails.

Nothing here needs the network, pytest, or Docker: the checks are `python3` scripts
that exit zero or non-zero, which is the smallest thing that demonstrates the shape.
