"""A dataset whose environment cannot work, for testing that it is refused.

This is not an example. It exists so that the two refusals §2.5.7 requires can be
exercised **end to end** rather than asserted about in the abstract, in the same spirit
as `data/leaky.py`:

* a service that declares `needs_model` when no environment-side model is configured
  (`HG_ENV_MODEL`) must stop the run at the door, because a simulator with no model
  produces a task that fails for a reason nothing records;
* with a model configured, the service's health check still never passes, so **no task
  produces a scoreable result** and the run must refuse rather than write a curve point.

That second one is the reason this file exists. `mean([])` is `0.0`, so a run whose
tasks were all unmeasurable would otherwise record a score of zero -- which says "the
harness scored nothing" about a run in which the harness never ran. Getting that wrong
is silent, produces a plausible number, and is exactly the class of claim this platform
exists to stop.
