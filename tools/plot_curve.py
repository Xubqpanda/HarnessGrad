It also refuses to let you compare things that are not comparable. Two runs made
under different isolation modes, or different sandbox plans, put numbers on the same
axis that were produced under different rules -- and the whole reason this platform
records `run_meta.json` is so that a reader can tell. A table that silently mixes
them undoes that.
