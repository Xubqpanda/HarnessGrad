"""Publish the host's egress proxy to the docker bridge, for task checks to use.

Why this exists
---------------
The machine's proxy (our own mihomo, `~/.config/harnessgrad-proxy/`) binds `127.0.0.1`, and
a container cannot reach the host's loopback -- it has its own. A task's check, however,
often needs the internet: measured across the Terminal-Bench checkout, **83 of 89**
`test.sh` files bootstrap their own test runner with `curl https://astral.sh/uv/... | sh`.
Without a route, the check never runs, and the platform recorded that as a task the
*harness* failed.

So this forwards `172.17.0.1:<port>` to the host's proxy with the same byte pump the model
gateway uses. It is bound to the docker bridge address only: containers can use it, the LAN
cannot. The platform then hands `HG_EGRESS_PROXY=http://172.17.0.1:<port>` to the check's
process (`eval/runner.py:_check_env`), and never to the harness -- a harness reaches its
model through the platform, and a proxy in front of that breaks it.

    python3 tools/egress_forwarder.py        # 172.17.0.1:17890 -> 127.0.0.1:17891
    ~/.config/harnessgrad-proxy/start-all.sh # that, plus the proxy itself

`HG_EGRESS_UPSTREAM` and `HG_EGRESS_PORT` change the upstream and the published port; the
defaults are the ones `docs/egress.md` documents.
