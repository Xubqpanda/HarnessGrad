"""Which tasks actually respond to harness quality -- and a split that keeps that.

**Where this comes from, and why we did not have it.** Evo-Bench's central
methodological contribution is *harness-guided benchmark construction*: it evolves
harnesses on a separate corpus, then keeps only the tasks whose score tracks harness
quality rather than the base model's, and splits by difficulty so that validation and
evaluation follow the same distribution (Abstract, §3). Their words: *"it leverages
auxiliary-task evolution to identify tasks genuinely sensitive to framework
improvements, followed by sensitivity-aware stratified splitting to ensure robust
cross-suite generalization."*

Our own split was whatever `data/terminal_bench.py` declared -- 52 train / 37 eval, one
line of a comment and no evidence that either side can tell a better harness from a
worse one. A task that every harness solves (or none does) contributes nothing to a
comparison and quite a lot of noise, and this platform's whole claim is that its numbers
mean something. So this tool measures it, with the definition Evo-Bench used:

    Perf(x)  = mean score of task x across harnesses
    quality(h | x) = harness h's mean score over the tasks **other than x**
    Sens(x)  = Pearson correlation over harnesses of  score(x, h)  against  quality(h | x)

`Sens(x) > 0` means "a harness that is good at the rest of the set is also good at this
task", which is what a task set used to compare harnesses needs. `Sens(x) <= 0` means the
task rewards something else -- noise, or a capability the rest of the set does not measure.
`Sens(x) = undefined` means the task's scores do not vary across the harnesses we ran, so
there is nothing to correlate; that is a fact about the task *and* about the harness set,
and it is recorded rather than turned into a zero.

**Three honest limits.**
  * The harnesses are the ones we have, not 12 evolved by four frontier models. Ours are
    the base reference, its variants, and the states previous runs actually reached -- a
    narrower quality range, so `undefined` will be more common than in Evo-Bench.
  * One evaluation per (harness, task) unless `--trials` says otherwise. The correlation
    is over harnesses, not over repeats, and `--trials` multiplies the cost by that factor.
  * A task's score here is whatever the platform's checker says it is, `invalid` cells
    excepted: a cell the platform could not measure is dropped from that task's
    correlation and counted, never filled with a zero.

The measurement itself is the platform's own `eval.runner.evaluate`, with one cache shared
across all harnesses (keyed by content hash, task and trial count), so re-running this cost
nothing and a run that is interrupted can be resumed by re-running it.
