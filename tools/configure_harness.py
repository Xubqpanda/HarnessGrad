"""Build a harness's dependency overlay, once, for each Python version it will meet.

    python3 tools/configure_harness.py --harness base_harness/loop --dataset terminal_bench
    python3 tools/configure_harness.py --harness base_harness/loop --python 3.13
    python3 tools/configure_harness.py --harness base_harness/loop --list

This is the "configure once" half of `eval/harness_runtime.py`: that module only looks
overlays up, because §2.5.5 puts anything that pulls or builds behind a human at import
time rather than on a run's path. Both halves exist so that a harness can be run against
a benchmark whose images already exist, **without rebuilding any of them**.

Why an overlay and not a derived image
--------------------------------------
`import_env.py --harness` bakes the dependencies into an image, which is `O(#task
images)` per harness -- 89 derived images for Terminal-Bench. Anyone arriving with their
own harness pays that before their first run. An overlay is `O(#Python versions)`, which
is a property of the *datasets*, not of the harnesses: measured 5 for Terminal-Bench
(3.13 x41, 3.12 x13, 3.11 x3, 3.10 x1, 3.9 x2, and 26 images with no interpreter at all,
which need nothing because the platform already provides one).

So the cost of a new harness does not move when the task set grows, which is the
property that makes "bring your own harness" true rather than aspirational.

How it is built
---------------
With the **task image's own** `pip`, into a directory outside every image:

    docker run --rm -v <overlay>:/out --entrypoint <the image's python> <task image> \\
        -m pip install --no-cache-dir --target /out -r <requirements>

Using a task image as the builder is deliberate and it is not a shortcut. It means the
wheels are resolved for *that* interpreter, on *that* platform tag, so a `3.13` overlay
cannot silently be a `3.12` one -- and it needs no base image to be pullable, which
matters on a host whose registry access is a flaky mirror.

Verification is by import, not by exit code: every installed distribution's recorded
top-level modules are imported with the target interpreter and the overlay on
`sys.path`. That is the check that catches an ABI mismatch, which is the failure this
whole design turns on (`pydantic_core` and `jiter` ship compiled extensions).
