"""Import a task environment, once, and pin it to a content address.

INTERFACE.md §2.5.5: *"It will not build a task's image during a run."* Building and
pulling are supply-chain events that execute third-party content with the daemon's
privileges, before any sandbox exists -- so they belong to a human at import time, not
to a dataset that a method may influence, and not to a run that a method can trigger.
This is the only tool in the repository that does either, and it is deliberately not
imported by the platform.

Three ways to import, all ending in the same output:

    # an image that already exists -- ensures it is local, then pins it
    python tools/import_env.py --image python:3.11-slim

    # a task's own image
    python tools/import_env.py --dockerfile tasks/foo/Dockerfile

    # a harness's dependencies, baked into the environment (§2.5.6 rule 2)
    python tools/import_env.py --image python:3.11-slim --harness base_harness/cli_agent

The output is the pinned reference and a `DEFAULT_ENV` block to paste into a dataset.
What it does **not** do is edit a dataset for you: rewriting a source file from a tool
is how a dataset ends up describing an image nobody chose.

## Why `--harness` lives here

`install` has been declared, validated and inert since the manifest gained the field,
because the harness tree is read-only by design and an install has nowhere to write.
The decision (§2.5.6) is that it goes **into the environment, at import time** -- the
per-harness half of the same one-time build as a task's Dockerfile:

    FROM <base>
    COPY . /opt/harnessgrad-install/
    RUN <the harness's own install command>

so `install` is the only place a harness's dependencies come from, and they are baked
into the image rather than installed into the host's interpreter. On the host they
cannot be installed at all: that would mutate a Python environment the platform does
not own, make two harnesses with conflicting pins both broken, and put a fact in the
run that no curve point records.

    see `container.resolve_digest`, which refuses in exactly this situation.

    **Mirrors are an import-time concern and only an import-time one.** On a host that
    cannot reach Docker Hub, a registry mirror is how an image arrives at all — and it
    arrives under the mirror's own reference, `<mirror>/<image>`, which is *not* the
    reference the benchmark publishes. So the image is pulled through the mirror and
    **re-tagged to its canonical name**, and the dataset goes on naming
    `alexgshaw/whatever:tag`. Without the re-tag, a dataset would have to know which
    mirror a particular machine used, and the digest on every curve point would carry a
    mirror's name into the record.

    Measured on this host: two of the three configured mirrors truncate large layers
