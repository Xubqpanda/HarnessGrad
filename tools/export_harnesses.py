"""Export a run's harness checkpoints into `current_harness/`, so they are visible.

Why this exists: every checkpoint is already stored -- as a git commit in the
run's workspace, which is a *better* store than a directory of copies, because git
is content-addressable. Identical files are stored once regardless of how many
revisions contain them, any revision can be extracted directly without replaying
diffs, and one damaged checkpoint does not invalidate the ones after it.

What is missing is not storage but **sight**. `runs/` is gitignored, so nothing
outside a run can answer "which harnesses did this base evolve into?". This tool
answers that by exporting the finished artifacts under a stable, browsable path.

    python tools/export_harnesses.py runs/<run-id>              # the nominated one
    python tools/export_harnesses.py runs/<run-id> --all        # every checkpoint

What is written, per checkpoint: the harness files (full code, not a diff) plus a
PROVENANCE.md recording the run, the commit, the method, the model and the score.
A directory of harnesses with no record of where they came from is a directory of
code nobody can use.
