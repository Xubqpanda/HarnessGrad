"""What a task needs in order to run, and what the platform could not measure.

`data/` declares an environment kind, `eval/container.py` pins an image; this is the
platform's half in between: narrowing a dataset to the tasks a run actually scores,
resolving image digests before anything is paid for, checking that a harness can operate on
the environment at all, and saying out loud which tasks the platform refused to score and
why.

A refusal is a record too. `_report_invalid` and `_report_harness_failed` are here because
"the platform could not measure this" and "the harness failed this" are different claims
and must not both arrive as a zero.
