"""The platform's implementation, layered so the dependencies point one way.

    identity        what a measurement is               (no docker, no http, no filesystem)
    environments    what a task needs in order to run
    records         writing the record
    channel         what a method is shown
    methods         calling an external method
    loops/          the three schedules: mode A, mode B, the eval side

`driver.py` stays at the repository root and stays the entrypoint: it is the path that
INTERFACE.md, `tools/serve_ui.py` and every recorded run's argv name. Keeping a documented
entry point and moving the body inwards is what `pip` and `pytest` do, for the same reason:
the name people type does not have to be the name the code lives under.

The rule the layering keeps is that a module imports only from the layers below it, so the
identity of a measurement can be computed in a test without a docker daemon, and "what a
number means" never has to depend on how the number was produced.

Not to be confused with `_harnessgrad/`: this package is the referee, that directory is the
one-way channel the platform fills for a method inside a run workspace. The underscore is
the whole difference on a filesystem, which is why the two never appear in the same
sentence in the code.
