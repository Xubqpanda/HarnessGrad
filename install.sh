# Install what HarnessGrad needs, then prove it works.
#
# The platform itself has no third-party Python dependencies -- everything it uses
# is in the standard library. What it needs from the machine is small, and one item
# is easy to get wrong:
#
#     bubblewrap   so a harness cannot see the platform while it runs
#     git          every checkpoint is a commit in the run's workspace
#     python3      >= 3.10 (dataclass syntax in the platform's own modules)
#
# `openai` is NOT installed here. It is imported only by a harness entrypoint that
# talks to a model (`base_harness/loop/agent.py:105`, lazily, inside the call), so a
# harness written in another language or against another provider never needs it.
# Install it yourself if you use the reference harness against an OpenAI-compatible
# endpoint.
#
# Why the last step is a self-check rather than a version check: having bubblewrap
# installed is not the same as the sandbox working. A kernel with unprivileged user
# namespaces disabled, or an AppArmor policy restricting them (the default on newer
# Ubuntu), leaves `bwrap` present and failing at runtime -- and a run that silently
# fell back to no sandbox would produce numbers that mean something other than what
# they say. So this script finishes by asking the platform to build a namespace and
# look for itself inside it.
#
#     ./install.sh            install what is missing, then verify
#     ./install.sh --check    verify only; change nothing
#     ./install.sh --yes      do not ask before installing (for CI)
