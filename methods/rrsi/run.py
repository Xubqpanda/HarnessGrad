"""RRSI's per-round decision rule, as a HarnessGrad method.

Why this file exists
--------------------
RRSI's contribution is not the edit an LLM makes -- it is the **rule that decides
whether a candidate harness is allowed to replace the incumbent, and how many edits
the round is allowed to bundle**. From its own selection module
(`rrsi/selection.py:30-38`):

    Delta S = S' - S_t,   Delta C = (C' - C_t) / C_t
    c = [Delta C <= beta0 + beta1 Delta S]             if Delta S > delta
        [w_s Delta S - w_c Delta C + w_n nu(l') > 0]   otherwise
    admissible  iff  S' >= S* - delta  and  c
    H_{t+1} = argmax_{H' admissible} S',  or H_t if none is admissible

Around that rule sit five other decisions RRSI makes every round, and this file
ports all six: the annealed edit budget, the stall flag and its reserved
exploration slot, the prune set, the novelty term, and the pre-evaluation leakage
critic. What differs from RRSI is only the loop around them: HarnessGrad's mode A
owns the schedule (one candidate per round, evaluated by the platform) whereas
RRSI owns its own loop (m candidates, k trials, its own evaluation).

Where each rule was read from
-----------------------------
* noise-adjusted floor   `rrsi/selection.py:107-111`
* two-branch cost rule   `rrsi/selection.py:81-94`
* novelty nu(l')         `rrsi/components.py:103-108`
* annealed budget b_t    `rrsi/schedule.py:43-50`
* stall flag sigma_t     `rrsi/history.py:189-193`
* exploration reserve    `rrsi/history.py:196-211`
* prune set B_t          `rrsi/history.py:143-163`
* relative cost Delta C  `rrsi/evaluate.py:131-135`
* component vocabulary   `rrsi/components.py:44-100`
* leakage critic         `rrsi/critic.py:105-154`
* calibration (partial)  `rrsi/calibrate.py:85-108`

What is transplanted
--------------------
**The decision rules, as pure functions, against this platform's curve points.**
`_edit_budget`, `_stall_flag`, `_exploration`, `_prune_set`, `_novelty`,
`_cost_rule`, `_judge`, `_classify_diff`/`_normalize`/`_has_evidence` and the two
critic layers are RRSI's algorithms with this platform's data in place of its
`EvalResult`/`History` objects. The critic is real: a deterministic denylist runs
first, a model review second, and a rejection sends the objections back to the
proposer for a bounded number of repair rounds (`rrsi/critic.py:113-154`).

**The state the rules need is reconstructed from the platform's own record.**
RRSI keeps `history.jsonl` (one record per edit: component, accepted, Delta S,
Delta C). This platform keeps one curve point per round, so a component touched by
round *i*, the score series, and Delta S = S(i) - S(i-1) are recovered from the
points themselves, where `S` is the diagnostic score of that point -- which field
holds it is decided by `score_kind`, see `_train_score` below. The method also declares `touched_components`
in `method_reported.rrsi_rule`, which is the one piece of state the points cannot
otherwise carry, and which a later round reads back out of them.

What is *not* transplanted
--------------------------
RRSI's scaffolding: its analyst/digester/proposer role prompts, its git worktrees,
`frontier.json`, its harbor domain adapters, and its `k` trials per task. None of
that is the method; the platform already supplies a task set, execution, scoring
and a per-round record. Reimplementing it here would be reimplementing the
platform.

What is *not reproduced*, and why -- stated plainly
---------------------------------------------------
Mode A hands this method one pristine incumbent, measures **one** candidate, and
**accepts it unconditionally** (there is no reject step; the driver never asks the
method again about a state it already measured). Therefore:

1. **The `m`-candidate argmax is not expressible.** Mode A drafts one candidate, so
   `argmax_{H' admissible} S'` has a single term. `_judge` can judge one candidate;
   there is no pool to take a max over.
2. **"No admissible candidate => stay at H_t" is not expressible.** Mode A always
   advances to the candidate it was handed. So this file does not pretend to veto
   anything: it **re-adjudicates** the incumbent it was handed -- it reports what
   RRSI's rule *would have said* about the round that produced the current state --
   and labels that record as a re-adjudication of a decision the platform already
   made unconditionally. The forward-looking numbers (S*, delta, the next floor
   `S* - delta`) are reported so the record shows what RRSI would demand next.
3. **Delta cannot be calibrated from per-trial rewards.** `calibrate.py` builds the
   null band either from R >= 2 repeated evaluations of the base harness or by
   bootstrapping over per-trial rewards. The platform records one score per task
   per round -- no per-trial rewards, no repeated base evaluations -- so neither
   estimator can be fed here. `_delta_from_repeated_base` transplants the formula
   verbatim for reference, but `main` reads `delta` from `HG_RRSI_DELTA` and, when
   that is unset, from `HG_RRSI_DELTA_FALLBACK`, and the record says which one it
   used.
4. **A dropped candidate costs the whole trajectory, not one slot.** In RRSI a
   critic rejection or an over-budget proposal is a `gate_failure`: the candidate is
   dropped and another is drafted (`rrsi/loop.py:299-302`). Mode A drafted only one,
   so this file reports `changed: false` with the objection recorded -- the honest
   reading, and the reason the trajectory may stop early where RRSI's would not.

The one place the port is deliberately stricter than RRSI: RRSI substitutes
`Delta C = 0` whenever either side reports no token count (`evaluate.py:131-135`),
which lets a cost rule that never fired look like a cost rule that passed. This
file computes the same 0.0 but marks `cost_rule_active: false` and leaves
admissibility `null` instead. A rule fed a constant zero permits everything, and a
record must not present that as a verdict.

Which score the rule reads
--------------------------
**The diagnostic side, and never the exam.** The method is shown the traces and the
per-task scores of the side it studies (`INTERFACE.md` §2.3), and selecting on the
exam is exactly the leak the split exists to prevent. Since §2.6 a run covers one
side, so which *field* holds the diagnostic score depends on the record:
`score_kind == "training"` means `score` **is** the diagnostic (`train_score` is
absent by design on a single-side run -- it would be a copy of `per_task`), while a
record predating §2.6 carries both and there `train_score` is the diagnostic.
`protocol.studied_score` decides, from `score_kind` and never by trying `score`
first. `request["incumbent_score"]` is never fed to the rule or to the prompt. When
there is no usable signal the rule reports `S_star: null` / `rule_evaluated: false`
rather than falling back to the exam.

Tunables (environment, with defaults)
-------------------------------------
RRSI's paper instances hard-code per-domain values (`rrsi/config.py:56-85`), so
every number below is read from the environment and defaulted to the published
value only where the value is actually RRSI's:

  HG_RRSI_T              20      anneal horizon T (schedule.py)
  HG_RRSI_B_MIN          1       b_min (schedule.py)
  HG_RRSI_B_MAX          4       b_max (schedule.py)
  HG_RRSI_W              3       stall window w (history.py)
  HG_RRSI_M_DRAFT        1       reserved exploration slots; capped at mode A's m=1
  HG_RRSI_DELTA          unset   calibrated noise band; unset = use the fallback
  HG_RRSI_DELTA_FALLBACK 0.0     delta used when no calibration exists (NOT RRSI's)
  HG_RRSI_DELTA_Z        2.0     z for delta = z * sd(null Delta S) (calibrate.py)
  HG_RRSI_BETA0          0.10    beta0 (config.py)
  HG_RRSI_BETA1          40.0    beta1 (config.py)
  HG_RRSI_W_S            100.0   w_s (config.py)
  HG_RRSI_W_C            15.0    w_c (config.py)
  HG_RRSI_W_N            0.5     w_n (config.py)
  HG_RRSI_N_PRUNE        4       n_prune (config.py)
  HG_RRSI_REPAIR_ROUNDS  5       critic -> proposer repair attempts (config.py)
  HG_RRSI_CRITIC_ATTEMPTS 3      critic JSON retries (critic.py:131)

The honest summary: **RRSI's per-round decision rules are RRSI's, the loop around
them is the platform's.** A run of this method is evidence about those rules, not a
reproduction of RRSI's published results.

degenerate, or self-destructive.

REJECT if ANY of:

1. LEAKAGE / TASK-SPECIALIZATION: the diff hard-codes knowledge of specific tasks:
   task names or ids, entity/company/case names, task-specific file names, expected
   outputs or answers, magic constants that only make sense for one task, per-task
   templates, or branching on task-identifying features. Litmus test: would this

2. DEGENERATE: effectively a no-op (dead code, unused flag, comment-only) while
   claiming a mechanism, or it deletes/disables an existing safety mechanism
   (context compression, output truncation, error handling, termination guards)
   without a working replacement.
3. GRADER GAMING: it tries to read, detect, reconstruct or influence the verifier /
   judge / rubric at runtime, hard-codes a threshold or reference value that could
   only have come from a grader, or games the output format for the grader rather
   than improving task performance.
4. UNDECLARED BUNDLING: the declared edit list is in the payload. Reject only if the
   diff contains independent changes not covered by ANY declared edit, or one
   declared edit secretly bundles several independent mechanisms.
5. RUNTIME MEMORY / SKILL LEAKAGE: if an edit adds memory/state or a skill
   mechanism, inspect what it PERSISTS or INJECTS at runtime. Entity-free general
   procedures are fine. Reject if a code path can persist or inject task-specific
   runtime data across trials (captured file contents, tool outputs, computed
   answers, task/entity/file names, per-task solutions keyed by task identity).
6. UNBOUNDED WORK: an added check, retry or "keep improving" loop with no give-up
   path, or anything implying finishing should wait for a confirmation that may
   never come.

Otherwise ACCEPT. Review intent and content, not style. Runtime correctness is NOT
your job: you only see the diff, so never speculate that something is undefined or
would crash.
