"""The generic diagnose-and-edit method -- and the editor every other method composes with.

This is the loop every published method runs in some form:

    1. read the base harness
    2. read the traces the platform staged  (`_harnessgrad/traces/`)
    3. ask a model what to change, given only what it can see
    4. write the changed files into a candidate directory
    5. hand the candidate back; the PLATFORM measures it

Step 5 is where this file stops on purpose. A method that scores its own candidate
is a method that can report an improvement it did not make.

What it can and cannot see
--------------------------
It sees the trace of each task: the tool calls, their outputs, and how the run
ended. It does **not** see the expected answers -- those are the platform's, and a
method that can read them is not being measured, it is being helped. That
restriction is why a diagnosis can fail: on a task set where the base harness is
failing for a reason no edit can fix (the model simply does not know the answer),
the honest outcome is `no_change`, and this method is allowed to say so.

A defect this file carried for its whole life
---------------------------------------------
Until the shared editor was extracted, this method read the traces from
`request["workspace"]`. That is the method's own empty scratch directory.
`INTERFACE.md` §4.7 puts `_harnessgrad/` inside the **harness** directory, so the
read always failed and every prompt this method ever built said
`(no traces available)`. It proposed edits from the harness source alone while
this docstring claimed it read how the harness behaved.

Measured, not guessed: with a trace staged at the contract path and an empty
workspace, the old code reported `(no traces available)` and the current code
reports the trace. `methods/editor.py:channel()` is now the only place that
decides where to look, so this cannot regress in one method without regressing in
all of them.

What this method is *not*
-------------------------
It is not an RSI method with a rule of its own: it is the plain hill-climb with no
selection statistic, no archive, no acceptance test beyond the platform's own
measurement. Published methods differ from it precisely in the rule they add
around it -- SICA's confidence bound, DGM's archive, AHE's constraint level. It is
kept because it is the shared editor and because it is the honest control for
"does the rule add anything over the plain loop".
