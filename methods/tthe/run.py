"""TTHE's per-round decision rule, as a HarnessGrad method.

Why this file exists
--------------------
TTHE does not improve a harness with a single hill-climb step. Its live loop
(`text_to_sql/optimize.py`; that file's own header says the sibling modules are
diagnostics/ablations, NOT this loop) runs, per unlabeled batch of questions:

    G fixed branches x R rounds; each branch edits ONLY its own previous
    harness; every branch deep-reads every active candidate's traces as peer
    evidence; a round's child is accepted only if it imports and passes the
    frozen-solver / label-free audit and leaves a valid proposal card; after R
    rounds one agentic judge picks among EVERY harness observed in the batch,
    with the incoming incumbent always in the pool.

This file ports that decision rule onto HarnessGrad's mode A, where the platform
owns the schedule and measures exactly one candidate per round.

The rule, and where it lives in TTHE
------------------------------------
* Fixed-branch search with shared evidence — `optimize.py:381` (`branches =
  [H] * args.group`), `optimize.py:383-384` ("each proposer receives its own
  branch as the mechanically pre-copied edit base"), `proposer.py:306-332`
  (peers are listed as PEER EVIDENCE, the assigned base is edited in place).
* A fixed branch-role schedule — `proposer.py:122-142` (`DIVERSITY`),
  `proposer.py:145-147` (`candidate_diversity(gi) -> DIVERSITY[gi % 3]`, whose
  docstring says the generation round never changes it).
* A validity-only acceptance gate — `optimize.py:404-406`
  (`accepted = child if child and _loadable(child, db0) else base`),
  `optimize.py:497-516` (`_loadable`: it imports AND passes the AST/token
  audit), `proposer.py:456-515` (a child with no valid proposal card is
  `None`), `proposer.py:154-193` (`valid_proposal_card`, the fixed key/type
  check). No score and no gold enter this gate.
* The rollback gate — `optimize.py:437-458`: the judge chooses from every
  harness observed this batch, the incumbent is in the pool, and a judge failure
  keeps it (`H = picked if picked in final_candidates else H`), so the
  accumulated harness cannot regress by construction.
* Label-free evidence discipline — `proposer.py:326,344-351,359-371,387`, with
  the invariants named in `harness_base.py:20-40` and checked in
  `audit_harness.py:25-37,40-97`.

What is transplanted (and how mode A expresses it)
--------------------------------------------------
* **The branch-role schedule**: `DIVERSITY[round_index % 3]` (`role_for` below).
  TTHE fixes the role by branch index `gi` across all rounds of a batch
  (`proposer.py:145-147`); mode A exposes one branch per round, so the index
  that varies is the round index and the period stays 3. The role wording is
  adapted for a foreign harness (mode A has no peers and no back-translation);
  the three-way schedule is TTHE's.
* **The validity gate, as "do not spend a round on a challenger that would be
  indistinguishable from the incumbent".** TTHE drops an invalid child back to
  its parent (`optimize.py:404-406`). Mode A cannot reject a candidate it has
  already measured, so the gate is moved to the only place a method controls:
  around the model call. If the staged evidence shows no failing question
  (`_validity_gate`), the round stops with `changed: false`; if the reply leaves
  no valid proposal card, or no usable edit, the method names the incumbent.
* **The rollback gate, as "the incumbent is always an admissible outcome".**
  TTHE's judge pool always contains the incoming `H`. Mode A has no judge, so
  every failure path (`no_change`, a missing/mistyped card, an unusable edit, a
  provider error) returns the incumbent unchanged with `changed: false`; by
  construction this method cannot hand back something worse than what it was
  given. `changed: false` is also how mode A is told not to spend another round
  (`INTERFACE.md` §4.55).
* **The label-free discipline, as prompt constraints** on the shared editor: no
  hardcoded task values, the task description / Hint is authoritative, no custom
  parser or backtracking regex (it hangs the GIL), the controller — not the
  proposer — executes the child exactly once per question, and target the
  failing questions with general mechanisms.
* **The proposal-card requirement, as a structured self-report recorded in
  `method_reported`.** The model supplies the four content lists; the method
  fills the controller-known fields (`candidate`, `branch_id`,
  `generation_round`, `base_candidate`, `peer_candidates`, `role`) and validates
  the result the way `proposer.py:154-193` does.

What is NOT transplanted
------------------------
TTHE's scaffolding: the `SQLHarness` class, its DB bridge, the Claude-Code worker
subprocesses with `killpg` hard deadlines, `isolated_solve`, the per-run trace
directory layout, and its transductive batch stream. None of it is the decision
rule; the platform already supplies a task set, execution, scoring, and a record
of every round. Reimplementing it here would be reimplementing the platform.

What is NOT reproduced — and why the port says so instead of pretending
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mode A hands one pristine incumbent, measures one candidate per round, and
accepts it unconditionally; there is no reject step. So the following parts of
TTHE **cannot be expressed here**, and this port does not fake them:

* **The `G x R` same-batch candidate pool, and therefore the agentic judge.**
  `optimize.py:437-458` picks among several same-batch harnesses. Mode A never
  exposes several same-batch candidates, and a method that scores its own
  candidate is exactly what the platform forbids (`INTERFACE.md` §0). TTHE's
  judge is deliberately *not* `argmax(score)` — it re-runs its own probes and
  reads proposal cards — so reimplementing it as an argmax would be inventing a
  decision TTHE does not make.
* **The transductive per-batch scoring protocol** (`optimize.py:358-361,464-471`):
  adapt to a batch, then score with the harness chosen for that same batch. Mode
  A scores on a fixed task set selected once from H0 (`INTERFACE.md` §2.1).
* **TTHE's label-free proxies** — the back-translation (`bt.py:1-10`,
  `proposer.py:338-340`) and the metamorphic paraphrase-INVariance /
  counterfactual-SENSitivity fitness (`evaluator.py:1-10`). Both presuppose a
  natural-language question with a literal answer key and a rewriter model; a
  foreign base harness has neither, so there is no honest way to compute them.
* **The concrete audit symbol names.** `audit_harness.py`'s `FROZEN_ATTRS`,
  `GOLD_NAMES`, and friends are TTHE's own identifiers. Only the *intent*
  travels (frozen solver, label-free), and the platform already validates a
  candidate by measuring it — better evidence than a name list.

The honest summary: **the per-round decision rule is TTHE's; the schedule, the
scoring, and the acceptance are the platform's.** A run of this method is
evidence about TTHE's decisions under mode A, not a reproduction of TTHE's
results.
