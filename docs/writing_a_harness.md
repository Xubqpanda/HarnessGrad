# Writing a harness for HarnessGrad

This is what a harness must satisfy to be dropped in and measured. It is written
for someone contributing a harness, not for someone reading the platform's
internals.

**The short version:** a harness is a repository with a `harness.json`, and a
program that turns one task into one answer. Everything else — language, tools,
control flow, memory, how many models it calls — is yours.

---

## 1. What a harness is

A harness is **a directory** containing a `harness.json` and whatever code you
want. It does not have to be the root of a git repository, and the platform never
looks inside it.

Three things are fixed, and they are fixed so that a harness can be measured at
all rather than because the platform has opinions:

| # | Fixed | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | `harness.json` at the harness root | so the platform can identify and invoke it |
| F2 | one command that solves one task | so any harness, in any language, is measurable |
| F3 | one answer file | so scoring does not depend on your output format |

---

## 2. `harness.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-harness",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "path": ".",
  "entrypoint": "run.py",
  "backend": "cli",
  "install": "requirements.txt"
}
```

| field | required | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | **yes** | identity; appears on every curve point |
| `version` | **yes** | identity; bump it when behaviour changes |
| `path` | no (default `"."`) | where the harness lives, relative to the repo root. Use `"."` if the harness *is* the repo. Needed when a harness is a subdirectory of a larger project. |
| `entrypoint` | **yes** | the file the platform runs |
| `backend` | no (default `"cli"`) | how the entrypoint is driven; `cli` is the only backend implemented today |
| `install` | no (default `null`) | dependency file relative to the harness root — a `requirements.txt` (pip) or a `.sh` (shell). **Runs once, at import time**, baked into the environment the task declares: `python tools/import_env.py --image <base> --harness <this dir>`. It never runs during a measurement, because the harness tree is read-only then and the platform does not install into the host's interpreter. See INTERFACE.md §2.5.6. |
| `env_kinds` | no (default `["files"]`) | which environments this harness can operate on. The platform refuses a run whose dataset needs a kind you do not declare, rather than scoring it zero on every task. Declaring `"exec"` means your harness can run inside a container — so it must be **self-contained except for `install`**: the image is not the host, and the host's interpreter, packages and paths are not there |
| `install` (again, for `exec`) | — | if you declare `"exec"`, list your dependencies here. The image will not have them, your tree is read-only during a run, and a missing import fails with a traceback the platform records as an exit code — which reads like a weak harness. Measured: the platform's own base harness scored zero on every container task for `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'` |
| `runtime_paths` | no (default `[]`) | absolute trees the sandbox must bind read-only because you need them — a CLI installed outside `/usr`, a runtime you were built against. Applies to `files` **and** `exec`: a task image need not have any runtime at all — the real Terminal-Bench images ship no `python3` — so the platform mounts the interpreter it invokes your entrypoint with, and mounts whatever you list here read-only beside it. |

**`name` and `version` are the harness's identity and a method may not change
them.** Everything else in the directory is yours, and a method that improves
your harness is allowed to rewrite any of it — including the entrypoint.

> If you are contributing a *base* harness for others to improve, pick a version
> and keep it stable: every curve point records it, and two runs under different
> versions are not comparable.

## 3. The task contract

The platform calls:

```
<entrypoint> --task <task.json> --workdir <dir>
```

### 3.1 What you are given

`task.json`:

```json
{
  "task_id": "t01",
  "goal": "Answer with the word alpha.",
  "inputs": {}
}
```

| field | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `task_id` | opaque identifier. **Do not parse it** and do not depend on its format. |
| `goal` | the task, in natural language. This is the only field a harness must understand. |
| `inputs` | optional map of name → content for tasks that need fixtures. Absent for most tasks. |

**`goal` is the contract; `inputs` is a convenience.** A harness that handles
`goal` alone is valid. A harness may ignore `inputs` entirely.

### 3.2 What you produce

Write the answer to `<workdir>/answer.txt`. The platform compares its stripped
contents, case-insensitively, against the task's expected answer.

**Scoring is deliberately dumb** — exact match on a normalized string. It is not
a judgement of quality, and it is not extensible by the harness, because a
harness that can influence its own scoring cannot be compared with another one.

The exit code must be `0` on completion. A non-zero exit is recorded as a harness
failure and scores zero for that task; it does not abort the run.

### 3.3 What you may do

Write files, spawn subprocesses, and make network calls. Two places are yours, and the
difference between them is only where your harness expects to find things:

* **`--workdir`** — the task's working directory, and the process's cwd. Create, read
  and delete whatever you like. Fresh for every task, thrown away afterwards.
* **`.state/`** — inside your own tree, beside your code. For a harness that writes a
  cache or a session file relative to itself, this is the one that works without your
  having to know where `--workdir` is. `HARNESSGRAD_STATE` holds its absolute path if
  you would rather not assume the layout.

**Nothing persists between tasks, and that is a design decision rather than a
limitation.** Each task gets fresh directories and the next task gets different ones.
If you want to measure cross-session memory, wrap the sessions into a single task: then
remembering is part of what your harness does, and its score depends on its own
behaviour. The alternative -- storage the platform preserves across the task set --
would make a harness's score depend on what the platform supplied rather than on the
harness, and no curve could tell the two apart.

**The code in your tree is read-only, and this is not a request.** That is measurement,
not distrust: one copy of your harness scores *every task in the round*, so a harness
that rewrote its own `agent.py` while answering task 1 would be a different program by
task 2, and the curve would report one harness where two ran. `.state/` is gitignored,
so what you write there never changes your sha.

Your harness runs in its own mount namespace. Measured from inside it:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `HarnessGrad/driver.py`, `harnessgrad/`, `eval/`, `methods/`, `.env` | **not readable** |
| every other run's workspace | **absent** |
| `HG_METHOD_*` (the method's model and budget) | **not in the environment** |
| your own harness tree, at its host path | readable |
| — the code in it | **not writable** |
| — `.state/` inside it | **writable**, private to the task |
| `--workdir` | present, writable |
| `/tmp` | private, writable |
| `$HOME` | not present |
| `HG_AGENT_*` (your model) | present |
| `HARNESSGRAD_STATE` | absolute path to your `.state/` |
| the network | unrestricted |

The first two rows are absence, not permission. The platform's directory survives
as an empty mount point -- the name is visible, the contents are not -- and an empty
directory is a very different thing from a readable one. There is no `EACCES` to work
around because there is nothing there to be denied.

Paths are the same inside and outside. A harness that records `/…/workspace/foo`
in its trace is naming a path that exists on the host too, so your evidence survives
the sandbox. The namespace costs about 11 ms per task.

If you write no further than `--workdir`, none of this concerns you. A harness that
wants a cache should put it in `--workdir` or `/tmp`, both of which are writable and
private to the task. `$HOME` is not present (the variable is set, the directory is
not), so anything that lazily creates `~/.cache/...` raises -- loudly and
immediately, which is the intended trade. The alternative is a harness whose score
depends on what a previous run left behind.

---

## 4. What is deliberately not specified

Stated so that their absence is not read as an oversight:

* **Language and runtime.** The platform invokes a command. Python, Node, a shell
  script and a compiled binary are all acceptable.
* **Tools, prompts, control flow, memory, number of model calls.** This is the
  substance of a harness and precisely what a method is supposed to improve.
* **Whether you call a model at all.** A harness with no model is legal and
  useful as a floor.
* **Environment.** Each task gets a fresh working directory, a **writable `$HOME`
  and `XDG_*`**, and a writable `.state/` inside your tree. Nothing else on the host is
  visible or writable: the platform's own tree is hidden, and `/tmp` is private to the
  task. Anything you need outside `/usr` you must name in `runtime_paths`.
* **Your model.** You may read `HG_AGENT_*`. If you got your model from somewhere else,
  write a `harness_identity` event into your trace — otherwise the curve point records
  a model that did not run. See INTERFACE.md §3.

## 5. Checking your harness before contributing

```
python tools/validate_harness.py path/to/your/harness
```

It checks the required fields, that the entrypoint exists, and — with `--smoke` —
that the harness runs a trivial task and writes an answer. Getting this to pass is
the whole contribution requirement.

---

## 6. The reference harness

`base_harness/loop/` is the minimal example: a ReAct loop, one `bash` tool, eight
steps, no middleware, no memory, no sub-agents. Read it as the smallest thing
that satisfies this document, not as a good harness.

**Known limitation, and it matters when choosing a baseline:** on a benchmark
where the model is the bottleneck rather than the harness, a harness this thin
leaves evolution nothing to win. Two published results say the same thing from
opposite ends — an evolution run starting from a single-tool harness scored
*below* simply sampling the same model more times (67.4 vs 68.2), while gains on
strong harnesses were largest for the weakest models (+44.0% vs +11.2%). **A base
harness should be thin enough that improving it is legitimate, and thick enough
that there is something to improve.**
