"""What a run is doing *right now*, as events a panel can render.

Why this exists
---------------
`events.jsonl` used to describe a run only at round granularity: a header, then one
line per finished round. That is enough to read a curve after the fact and useless
while it is being produced. Measured on `loop-terminal_bench-26452`: round 0's five
tasks took ~100 minutes, the driver was working the whole time, and the log held
**eleven** lines -- six notes, a header, a warn and one round. The console UI polls
that file every 1.5s and redraws only when it changes, so it showed the same screen
for over an hour. A watcher cannot tell that from a hung process, and neither can
the person who has to decide whether to kill it.

So progress is a first-class record, not a by-product of printing:

    task    a task started, or finished, in a round           (round, i/n, task_id)
    phase   one stage of that task started or finished        (phase, status, elapsed)
    beat    a phase that is still running                     (phase, elapsed)
    over    a phase that ran past the budget it declared      (phase, elapsed, budget)

Three properties, each of which cost a design decision:

* **Every event is durable when it happens.** `Console.emit` flushes per record, so a
  run killed mid-task has an honest record up to the kill. That is the run somebody
  needs to read.
* **Beats are cheap and boring.** One thread, one line per `BEAT_S`, carrying no
  output and no state -- a heartbeat that is expensive to produce becomes the thing
  that slows the run down, and a heartbeat that carries state becomes a second copy
  of the run to keep in step.
* **The phase names are shared, not invented per call site.** `PHASES` is the one
  list; `eval/runner.py` opens phases by name, and a panel that has never seen this
  module can still say what "agent" means. A free-form label would drift.

The reporter is reached through a `ContextVar`, not through parameters. That is a
deliberate exception to this codebase's habit of passing things explicitly, and it is
bounded by the dispatch it serves: `runner.evaluate` -> `runner.run_one` ->
`container.*` is one call chain, in one thread, and threading a reporter through it
would change eight signatures in `eval/container.py` to move a *log line*. The
context is set by the driver for the duration of one evaluation and by the runner for
the duration of one task, so nothing outside an evaluation can emit progress and the
log stays a record of the run rather than of the platform.
