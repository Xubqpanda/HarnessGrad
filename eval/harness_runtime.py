"""A harness's own Python dependencies, provided from **outside** the task's image.

The problem this solves
-----------------------
A harness is arbitrary code the platform did not write, and it is written in Python
often enough that the platform invokes `python <entry>` by contract. Its dependencies
therefore have to be importable by whatever interpreter runs it -- and the two obvious
answers both fail somewhere:

* **the image's interpreter**, which §2.5.3 prefers, because "`bash`, the file editor
  and the interpreter are the image's". Measured on Terminal-Bench: 60 of the 86 local
  task images ship their own `/usr/local/bin/python3` and **none of them has `openai`**,
  so `loop` died on its first model call with `ModuleNotFoundError`, exit code 1, and a
  0-byte trace.
* **the platform's interpreter**, mounted in, which works but throws away §2.5.3 and
  weakens the one test that catches "the platform quietly ran it on the host".

And there is no third place: the harness tree is read-only during a run, so an install
has nowhere to write (§2.5.6).

What this module does instead
-----------------------------
It keeps the **image's** interpreter and adds a read-only directory to the harness
process's `sys.path`. The directory holds only the harness's declared dependencies,
resolved **for that interpreter's Python version**, and it is built once per
`(install contents, Python minor version)` -- not per task, and not per image.

The version key is not optional. Measured: a `3.13` overlay imported cleanly on four
different 3.13 task images and failed on four different 3.12 images with
`ModuleNotFoundError`, which is the loud failure we want. Sharing one overlay across
versions would be silent corruption; `jiter` and `pydantic_core` ship compiled
extensions and the ABI is per-version.

Why this and not baking into derived images
-------------------------------------------
Baking is `O(#task images)` per harness -- 89 derived images for Terminal-Bench -- so
anyone arriving with their own harness pays that before their first run. This is
`O(#Python versions in the dataset)`, which is 5 here (3.13 x41, 3.12 x13, 3.11 x3,
3.10 x1, 3.9 x2, no interpreter x26) and does not move when the task set grows.

What it costs, stated rather than hidden
----------------------------------------
`PYTHONPATH` is **inherited by the harness's subprocesses**, so a `python3 foo.py` the
harness runs also sees these packages. Measured harmless on Terminal-Bench -- the
closure overlaps no task's installs and no task's tests or solution imports any of
them -- but it is a mechanism, not a proof, so `record()` puts the fact on every curve
point. And the overlay is a **bind mount**, which `docker commit` does not include:
measured, the mount target exists in the snapshot and is empty, so the graded container
never sees these packages.

Lookup only
-----------
Nothing here builds or pulls. §2.5.5 puts both behind a human at import time, and this
module is on the run path. Building is `tools/configure_harness.py`; if no overlay
exists this returns `None` and the run proceeds exactly as it did before, which is why
installing this feature changes nothing for anyone who does not use it.
