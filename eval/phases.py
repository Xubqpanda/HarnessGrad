"""A run's phase vocabulary: one list, one set of labels, no second copy.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The same eight names were written out three times: `eval/progress.py` had the English
descriptions and the budgets, `eval/console.py` had two Chinese tables, and the console
panel had its own JavaScript table (which is why the panel now reads `phase_labels` out of
the run's header instead of keeping one). Adding one phase therefore meant remembering
three or four places, and forgetting one showed up as a raw identifier in the UI.

The vocabulary is small, has no dependencies, and both the writer (`eval/progress.py`) and
the readers (`eval/trace.py`, the panel) need it. It lives here so that "what phases exist"
is answered in one place.

Two label widths on purpose:

    PHASE_ZH       a full sentence, for a terminal line
    PHASE_SHORT    two to six characters, for the panel's one-line progress strip

They are not two vocabularies -- both are keyed by the same names, and every name has both.
