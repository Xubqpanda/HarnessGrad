"""Run the subject in its own mount namespace, so the platform is not on its disk.

The threat this closes
----------------------
`eval/runner.py` executes a harness the platform did not write. Until this module
existed the harness was an ordinary child process of the driver, which meant -- and
this was measured, not assumed -- that it could `open()` `driver.py`, read `.env`,
and write into `eval/metrics.py`. `eval/integrity.py` catches all three after the
fact. Catching is not preventing: the run is void, but the credentials have already
been read.

What was measured, before and after
-----------------------------------
A harness whose entrypoint probes its own surroundings, run with and without the
namespace:

                                bare        sandboxed
    HarnessGrad/.env            readable    absent
    HarnessGrad/driver.py       readable    absent
    HarnessGrad/eval/           readable    absent
    HarnessGrad/methods/        readable    absent
    other runs' workspaces      readable    absent
    HG_METHOD_* in the env      leakable    absent

    startup overhead            --          +11.1 ms (median of 15)
    one live model call         ~2100 ms    ~2100 ms
    relative cost               --          +0.53%

Neither a container nor an image is needed, which matters for a reason that is not
about speed: a container fixes the language and runtime, and `docs/writing_a_harness.md`
§4 promises the opposite. `bwrap` runs whatever the manifest names, so that promise
survives.

The rule the mount plan follows
-------------------------------
Paths are bound at **the same absolute path they have on the host**. No translation,
because every translation is a place where a harness's own record of what it did
stops matching the filesystem it did it on. The plan is therefore:

  1. bind the runtime the subject needs (`/usr`, `/bin`, the interpreter's prefix)
     and leave the rest of the host root alone,
  2. hide the tree that contains the platform *and* the work root, using an empty
     tmpfs -- the platform is not "permission denied", it is absent,
  3. bind the work root back, which re-exposes exactly one subtree of the hidden
     tree and no siblings,
  4. bind the task directory, which lives under `/tmp` and would otherwise be lost
     behind a tmpfs.

Step 2 is what makes step 3 safe: binding a directory exposes that directory, not
its siblings, so `harnessgrad_work/` reappears while `HarnessGrad/` stays gone.

What this does not do
---------------------
The subject still has unrestricted network access, and it still holds the agent's
API key, because a harness that cannot reach a model cannot be measured. It can
therefore exfiltrate that key to anywhere it likes. A namespace cannot fix this;
only egress filtering or a scoped key can, and neither is implemented. This is a
recorded gap, not an oversight -- see INTERFACE.md §4.8.

    under `/mnt/8t/.../anaconda3`, so covering `/mnt` left the subject unable to
    start and the failure read as a broken harness.

    So:

    * **the platform itself**, so the driver, the scorer and `.env` are not on the
      subject's disk. Its siblings stay visible, deliberately -- hiding a
      neighbouring work tree buys nothing and costs diagnostics.
    * **`/tmp`**, always and unconditionally. The task directory is bound back
      afterwards; without this, two runs on a machine whose work root is elsewhere
      would share a `/tmp` and could read each other's answers.

    The work root's parents are never touched, which is what makes the plan
    independent of where the trees sit: no common ancestor is required, so a work
    root on a different mount from the platform is fine. And since bwrap starts from
