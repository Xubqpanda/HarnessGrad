"""Run a task's harness and its check inside a container. INTERFACE.md §2.5.

This is the `exec` environment kind. It is a **second, independent boundary**, not a
replacement for `eval/sandbox.py`:

* `files` -- the harness runs on the host inside a bwrap namespace. The platform is
  hidden by not being mounted (`eval/sandbox.py`), and the runtime is the host's.
* `exec`  -- the harness runs **inside a container**. The platform is hidden the same
  way (it is not mounted), but the runtime, the interpreter and the tools are the
  image's, and `network: none` becomes available because the container has its own
  network namespace rather than borrowing the host's.

Three properties are load-bearing and each is a decision rather than an accident:

**The container is mounted from a digest, never a tag.** `:latest` moves, and two runs
under one tag are not two measurements of the same thing -- the same failure this
platform already shipped once for `agent_model`. `resolve_digest` is therefore not a
convenience: a run whose digest cannot be resolved **refuses to start** (§2.5.4).

**Nothing is built here.** A task image is built by `tools/import_env.py`, once, by a
human, at import time (§2.5.5). `docker run` on a missing image would silently pull
whatever the registry served that day; this module does not pull and does not build.
If the image is not on the local daemon, that is a refusal with instructions.

**The container is not given a way out of itself.** No docker socket, no host home, no
platform. It gets exactly three mounts (§2.5.3), and the order they are applied in is
load-bearing -- see `_mounts`.

# /app` is set by the image, `/app` ships *empty*, and the check reads `/app`. A bind
# mount would put the task somewhere the task itself did not put it.
#

# **commits** the result, and verifies against a fresh container from that snapshot.
