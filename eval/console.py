"""One place that decides how a run describes itself.

Why this exists
---------------
A run has two readers and they want different things:

    a person at a terminal    a few aligned lines, as it happens
    the console UI            events it can lay out as chips, rows and a table

Formatting those in two separate places guarantees they drift, and a log that has
drifted from the run is worse than an ugly one: it becomes evidence of something
that did not happen. So the driver narrates once, through here, and the text and
`events.jsonl` come out of the same call.

`events.jsonl` is appended and flushed per event rather than written at the end,
so a run killed mid-round still has an honest record up to the moment it died --
which is exactly the run whose log someone needs to read.

Events are the *record*; the text is a rendering of it. Where the two disagree,
the event is right.
