"""A wrapper: any prompt-taking agent CLI, as a HarnessGrad harness.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The harnesses worth measuring are increasingly CLIs -- Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode
and their relatives -- and none of them can be a HarnessGrad harness directly. They
do not take `--task`/`--workdir`, they do not write `answer.txt`, they keep their
session state under `$HOME`, and they read their model from their own config file
rather than from `HG_AGENT_*`.

So this is the thin translation layer, and it is deliberately the *only* place that
knows anything about a CLI:

    our contract            this wrapper                  the CLI
    --task <json>     ->    render the goal     ->   the prompt
    --workdir         ->    cwd                 ->   where it works
    (nothing)         ->    HG_CLI_ENV mapping  ->   the credentials it expects
    trace + answer    <-    parse its output    <-   what it printed

**Editing this file is how you support a new CLI.** The knowledge lives in
configuration (`HG_CLI`, `HG_CLI_ENV`, `HG_CLI_MODEL`), not in branches here, because
the next CLI is always slightly different and branches for each one do not compose.

What it deliberately does not do
--------------------------------
* **No model knowledge.** It never assumes which variable a CLI reads; `HG_CLI_ENV`
  declares the mapping. That is also how the platform's `HG_AGENT_*` values reach a
  CLI without the platform having to know the CLI.
* **No scoring.** It cannot see the verifier, and it does not report a score. It
  declares what it *was* (`harness_identity` in the trace) and exits.
* **No sandboxing of its own.** The platform's sandbox is the boundary. Whether the
  CLI's own approval prompts are bypassed is configuration, and it is recorded
  because "the harness's own sandbox is off" is a security-relevant fact.

Configuration (all optional except `HG_CLI`)
--------------------------------------------
    HG_CLI            the command, shell-quoted: e.g. `claude -p`
    HG_CLI_PROMPT     how the prompt reaches it: `argv` (default) | `stdin`
    HG_CLI_ENV        JSON: extra env for the CLI, `$VAR` expanded from ours
    HG_CLI_MODEL      what to declare as the model (falls back to HG_AGENT_MODEL)
    HG_CLI_NAME       what to declare as the harness (default: argv[0]'s basename)
    HG_CLI_TIMEOUT_S  its own timeout, so a hung CLI is reported rather than killed
