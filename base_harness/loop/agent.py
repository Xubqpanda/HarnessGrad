"""The reference base harness: a minimal ReAct loop.

Deliberately the simplest thing that satisfies the contract in
`docs/writing_a_harness.md`. Its job is not to be strong -- it is to be:

  1. a valid starting point that a method can improve, and
  2. the proof that the contract is implementable at all.

A method may replace every file here. That is the point.

**What is deliberately absent, and why.** This harness has no context policy, no
output bounding and no memory. Those are *mechanisms*: named, switchable
behaviours that a method adds in order to improve the harness. Shipping a set of
them by default would mean shipping one particular experiment's design as if it
were the platform's, and would make "this harness is thin" a claim nobody can
check. A base harness with nothing in it is the honest starting point; what a
method adds on top is the measurement.

#: How many model calls one task gets. **A floor on capability, not a tuning knob.**
#:
#: Measured at 8, on Terminal-Bench, 4 rounds x 5 tasks: four of the five tasks used all
#: eight and produced no graded artifact at all -- `build-pmars` was still installing
#: packages, `bn-fit-modify` had just finished installing pandas/numpy/sklearn and
#: printed one correlation matrix, `chess-best-move` had opened the PNG and never wrote
#: `/app/move.txt`. The score was 0.0 on every task in every round, which is not a weak
#: harness being measured: it is a floor effect, and a floor makes every method look
#: identical because there is no gradient for one to move.
#:
#: Raising this does not make the harness cleverer -- `adapters/harnessgrad_domain/`
#: already names this lever as the trap ("helps only if the model is already using the
#: steps it has"). Here the trace shows it *was* using them, which is exactly when the
#: lever is legitimate. What it costs is bounded by the task, not by this number: the
#: wall clock is capped by the environment's `agent_timeout_s` (900 s for most
#: Terminal-Bench tasks, 3600 s for `bn-fit-modify`). A step is fast (~0.2 s model round
#: trip through the local gateway), so the extra ceiling mostly buys back the steps that
#: environment setup eats. The loop still stops the moment the model answers -- the cap
#: is a ceiling, not a quota.
MAX_STEPS = int(os.environ.get("HG_AGENT_MAX_STEPS", "32"))

#: 模型说"我做完了"之后,允许它再被退回几次。
#:
#: 为什么需要这个:harness 以前**从不检查交付物**。模型回一句 {"answer": ...} 就被当成
#: 任务结束、退出循环。实测(2026-10-02,terminal_bench round 0):五道题的 agent 阶段是
#: 101s / 31s / 183s / **4.5s** / 105s —— 而步数上限是 32。4.5 秒等于一次模型调用就
#: "交卷"了,产物根本不存在;`cancel-async-tasks` 的判分因此是
#: `File /app/run.py does not exist`。
#:
#: 所以 0 分的机制不是"步数不够",而是"**harness 把模型说的完成当成了完成**"。
#: 一个会自己检查交付物、并把"文件不存在"退回给模型重试的 harness,才是这一步该有的样子。

    Tolerant extraction is not a nicety here; this function decides whether a task runs
    at all, and one of its failure modes cost two whole runs.

    The first version tried `json.loads(reply)`, then fell back to slicing from the first
    `{` to the **last** `}`. Both fail on the same reply shape, and that shape is what the
    measured model actually emits: asked for one action, it sometimes answers with two or
    three JSON objects, one per line --

        {"tool": "bash", "command": "cat /app/filter.py"}}
        {"answer": ""}

    (note the stray brace as well). `json.loads` reports `Extra data: line 1 column 50`,
    and the `rfind` fallback slices `{...}}{...}`, which is not JSON either. The harness
    treats an unparseable reply as a harness failure and **breaks the loop**, so the task
    ends at step 0 with an empty answer and scores 0.

    Measured on `loop-terminal_bench-41133`, round 0: four of five tasks died this way
    after a single model call (`calls: 1`, `parse_error: Extra data`), and every round
    after it was the same because the round starts from a harness that cannot do anything.
    The old run `loop-terminal_bench-26452c` produced single-object replies and got 8
    calls per task -- same code, same prompt -- so this is a property of the model's
    output that the parser has to absorb, not something the parser caused.

    `raw_decode` from the first `{` is the whole fix: it returns the first complete
    object and says where it stopped, so trailing objects, stray braces and prose around
    the JSON all stop mattering. `base_harness/loop_rrsi_parse/` already shipped exactly
    this ; it is the same code, because a parser that differs between two base harnesses
    is a difference between two candidates that the platform made rather than the method.
