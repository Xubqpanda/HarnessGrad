"""What the platform needs from a harness: the contract, not the content.

Which behaviours a harness has, and how they work, belongs to whoever writes it.
The platform needs exactly three things from any harness, and this file checks
those three against the reference one:

  1. it runs a task and writes an answer, so it can be measured at all;
  2. it reports what the run cost, so a harness cannot look free while spending;
  3. an edit a method makes to it survives into the run, so a method's improvement
     is not silently dropped.

Anything about *how* the harness behaves -- its context policy, its truncation
rules, its prompts -- is not the platform's business and is not tested here. An
earlier version of this file did test those, for a mechanism layer that came from
a different project's experiment design; it has been removed, and this is what
replaced the part that was ever ours.

# ------------------------------- harness 的 import 必须由它自己的依赖满足
#
# 这不是理论风险。实测(2026-10-02):为了让 harness 不复用空闲的 HTTP 连接,我在 `loop`
# 里写了 `import httpx` 去构造一个客户端 —— 而它声明的 `openai` 3.22.1 依赖的是
# **`httpx2`**(这个平台给 harness 装依赖用的是覆盖层,里面没有 `httpx`)。结果每次模型
# 调用都 `ModuleNotFoundError`,五道题各 0.9 秒就崩,而平台把这一轮记成了"五道题 0 分"。
#
# 一两行 import 就能把一次几小时的运行变成一堆 0,所以它值得一条不变量:
# **harness 里出现的非标准库 import,必须能在它自己的覆盖层里找到。**
