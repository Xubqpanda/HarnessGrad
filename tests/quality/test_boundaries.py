"""Boundary rules for the platform. INTERFACE.md §6.

The rules changed when methods moved out of the platform and into the harness
repositories. They are now sharper, and they are the load-bearing claim of the
whole design:

    The platform never contains a method, never imports one, and never writes
    to one. It reaches a method only through the entrypoints declared in the
    harness's own manifest.

Rules kept as prose get broken the first time someone is in a hurry. These run
in milliseconds and they fail loudly.
