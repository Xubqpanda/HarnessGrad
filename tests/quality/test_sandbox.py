"""The harness runs in its own mount namespace, or the run does not start.

Every test here exists because of a specific way this could be wrong, and two of
them are ways it *was* wrong while being developed:

1. A value-shaped guess at "is this environment variable a path?" deleted
   `HG_AGENT_API_KEY` out of the sandbox -- because `Path("deepseek-flash").resolve()`
   is relative to the platform's cwd and lands inside the hidden tree. The symptom
   would have been "the harness cannot reach a model", which reads as a harness
   defect. The test that catches it checks the sandbox **from the inside**, not the
   command line the platform built.
2. The same guess reported that `pnpm_config_verify_deps_before_run=false` was
   "under the hidden tree".

Both were false positives from asking a question that has no general answer. The
tests below pin the fix: the platform checks only the paths it set itself, and it
checks them by observing the subject's view rather than its own intent.
